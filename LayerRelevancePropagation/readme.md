# LayerRelevancePropagation
A repo to implement layer relevance propagation by self.

This repo contains the basic implementation of LRP_epsilon algorithm which works based on sklearn-MLPClassifier's neural network.

Two examples are given using differnet datasets, one is with sklearn built-in datasets 'digits' and other is for MLTSA one_d data.

Some code are directly from MLTSA repo, please refer to https://github.com/pedrojuanbj/MLTSA
